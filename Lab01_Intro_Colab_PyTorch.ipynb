        "\n",
        "- Google Colab is a cloud-based platform that enables us to run Python code directly in our web browser. It's convenient because it means we do not need to download Python or create an environment to execute our code -- all we need is an internet connection.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tips: Colab recommends using the newest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari browser for best results. I've tested these course notebooks using Chrome.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The notebooks you run in Colab are the same format as Jupyter notebooks (https://jupyter.org/). They will have the file extension: \".ipynb\".\n",
        "\n",
        "- You may have come across Jupyter notebooks in previous courses. The difference with Colab is that we're running the notebook \"in the cloud\", not on our local computer. But the files are the same kind. If you download any of our course Colab files (.ipynb) to your own computer, you can open them just like any other Jupyter notebook file.\n",
        "\n",
        "- You don't need to subscribe to a paid plan, but all students can sign up for a free [Colab Pro account](https://colab.research.google.com/signup?utm_source=dialog&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=too_many_sessions&authuser=1). This will provide better compute resources and prevent your sessions from timing out."
